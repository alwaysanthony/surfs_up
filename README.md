## Summary

Oahu seems to be a good location as the weather will be good year round. There is very little difference between the months of June and December for average and maximum temperatures, although there is a noticeable difference in minumum temperature. We can ignore the minimum temperature as these will probably only occur at night when no is surfing

One other thing to consider is rainfall. Here are the rain fall statistics for the months of June and December:

![dec temps](/resources/dec_rain.PNG)

As we can see the average rainfall for June is .13 inches and for December is .21 inches. Although these numbers are low, this is something we should consider when opening a surf and shake shop
